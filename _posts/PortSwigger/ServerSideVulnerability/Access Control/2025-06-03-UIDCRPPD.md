## 1. Statement

This lab has user account page that contains the current user's existing password, prefilled in a masked input.

To solve the lab, retrieve the administrator's password, then use it to delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

## 2. Challenge

### a. User ID controlled by request parameter with password disclosure, what is it ?

Horizontal to vertical privilege escalation
Often, a horizontal privilege escalation attack can be turned into a vertical privilege escalation, by compromising a more privileged user. For example, a horizontal escalation might allow an attacker to reset or capture the password belonging to another user. If the attacker targets an administrative user and compromises their account, then they can gain administrative access and so perform vertical privilege escalation.

An attacker might be able to gain access to another user's account page using the parameter tampering technique already described for horizontal privilege escalation:

https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=456

If the target user is an application administrator, then the attacker will gain access to an administrative account page. This page might disclose the administrator's password or provide a means of changing it, or might provide direct access to privileged functionality.

### b. Vulnerability Analysis

As the course explains it to us, as we arrive on the website, we want to try to connect ourselves on our account wiener:peter to look at the URL of the website :


![firstconnexion](/assets/img/posts/PortSwigger/ServerSideVulnerabilities/UIDCRPPD/firstconnexion.png)

We will, in a second time try a few URLs, like for example, we here want to try for headers like "admin" or "administrator", as we try it, we find the "connexion" page of the admin where we can try to change our password, however,
Here, we'll be using Burp to intercept the change request to find the password of the admin account.

After copying the administrator password, we then connect to his session and find many options, like the admnistrator panel

![final](/assets/img/posts/PortSwigger/ServerSideVulnerabilities/UIDCRPPD/final.png)

we can, now, delete the "Carlos" user just by pressing the Delete button next to his name and that ends the challenge, and hereby the writeup
