## 2. Challenge

### a. Unprotected admin Functionality, what is it ?

At its most basic, vertical privilege escalation arises where an application does not enforce any protection for sensitive functionality. For example, administrative functions might be linked from an administrator's welcome page but not from a user's welcome page. However, a user might be able to access the administrative functions by browsing to the relevant admin URL.

For example, a website might host sensitive functionality at the following URL:

https://insecure-website.com/admin
This might be accessible by any user, not only administrative users who have a link to the functionality in their user interface. In some cases, the administrative URL might be disclosed in other locations, such as the robots.txt file:

https://insecure-website.com/robots.txt

Even if the URL isn't disclosed anywhere, an attacker may be able to use a wordlist to brute-force the location of the sensitive functionality.

### b. Vulnerability Analysis

As the course explains it to us, as we arrive on the website, we want to try to search for :
https://lab-website.com/robots.txt which lead us to : 

![robot](/assets/img/posts/PortSwigger/ServerSideVulnerabilities/UnprotectedAdminFunctionality/robot.png)

User-agent: *
Disallow: /administrator-panel

We then want to see what is the administrator-panel about : 

https://lab-website.com/administrator-panel

As we find the administrator panel, we can, now, delete the "Carlos" user just by pressing the Delete button next to his name and that ends the challenge, and hereby the writeup
