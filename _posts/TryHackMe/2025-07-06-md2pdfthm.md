## 2. Challenge

### a. Challenge Discovery

As we read the statement, we, first, want to make our basics scans (nmap, gobuster) just to see which ports are open or closed and what we can do with it. However, after further analysis, we can guess that we will have to exploit the functionality of the web server (the one that converts the markdown to the PDF)

After the nmap, we see that the port 22,80 and 5000 are open, SSH ports is normal, http port is not a surprise and neither is the 5000 (upnp).

Anyway, we still proceed to do a gobuster directory bruteforce to see if something is missing (spoiler: no but it's a writeup so step by step should be fine for everyone)
![gobuster](/assets/img/posts/TryHackMe/MD2PDF/gobuster.png)

We then want to see the website and what process do the website follows to convert our md into a pdf. 
![website](/assets/img/posts/TryHackMe/MD2PDF/website.png)

A rather... simple website. 
We will now test its functionality ! we try to write "test" and we'll analyze the pdf that it will return with exiftool for example.
![exiftool](/assets/img/posts/TryHackMe/MD2PDF/exiftool.png)

We see that the website is using the wkhtmltopdf tool to convert the md to the PDF. we will now proceed to the vulnerability analysis.

### b. Vulnerability Analysis

We see that the it's wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5 that is running...

What there is to understand here is the use of wkhtmltopdf, it means that first, the website converts the MD into an HTML and THEN the HTML to the PDF.

It smells really strong like a SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) which means by the CVE-2022-35583 description that wkhtmlTOpdf 0.12.6 is vulnerable to SSRF which allows an attacker to get initial access into the target's system by injecting iframe tag with initial asset IP address on it's source. This allows the attacker to takeover the whole infrastructure by accessing their internal assets.


![CVE](/assets/img/posts/TryHackMe/MD2PDF/CVE.png)

Interesting... but, what do we want to get access to ? 

We look back at the gobuster results and see that there are a few directories (forbidden access but still... let's take a look). 

![adminpanel](/assets/img/posts/TryHackMe/MD2PDF/adminpanel.png)

We see that only the localhost:5000 can access the admin panel.. HTML, iframe, localhost... 

We will try something : 

```html
<iframe src="http://localhost:5000"></iframe>
```
![firsttry](/assets/img/posts/TryHackMe/MD2PDF/firsttry.png)

IT WORKS, not enough though, but that's just a skill issue. i forgot that we wanted the take a look at the admin panel...

Let's try again but this time let's add the /admin lol

```html
<iframe src="http://localhost:5000/admin"></iframe>
```
![flag](/assets/img/posts/TryHackMe/MD2PDF/flag.png)

This time, we find the flag and validate the challenge.

And that ends the challenge, and hereby the writeup. 

Thanks to all the people that read it all along.
